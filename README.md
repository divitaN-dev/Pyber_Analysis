## Overview of Project

The purpose of the analysis is to draw insigths from a large ride sharing dataset using Pandas and create informative visualisations with the graphing library - Matplotlib.

### Purpose

* To categorize data form the dataset into series, based on three city types - Urban, Rural, Suburban.
* Harness advanced Pandas functions to extract weekly fares by city type and use Matplotlib to create line charts for summary data.

## Results

* Urban cities had the highest number of total rides and drivers, lowest average fare per ride and lowest average fare per driver. These metrics resulted in the highest total fares earned.

* Suburban cities had the second highest number of total rides and drivers, second lowest average fare per ride and also; second lowest average fare per driver. These metrics resulted in the second highest total fares earned.

* Rural cities in contrast had the lowest number of total rides and drivers, and highest average fare per ride and highest average fare per driver. These metrics resulted in the lowest total fares earned.

* There appears to be a negative corelation between the number of rides and drivers, And, average fares per ride and average fares per driver.

* Over a period of four months, the latter weeks of Februrary saw the highest overall fares for all city types.

* The overall ranking by fares earned remained consistent with Urban cities generating most fare revenue and Rural cities generating the least.

### Rideshare Analysis Summary

Based on the results, the following actions could help boost overall revenue, increase affordability, jobs and covergage in underserviced cities -

* An increase in the number of drivers in rural and suburban cities will lower the average fare per driver and could increase ride affordability. These measures may result in more rides and consequently more revenue.

* An incentive program such as discount coupons or free first rides, could encourage more people to try the ridesharing service, which could result in a lower average fare ride. These measures may lead to an increased ridership and revenue.

* A 6-12 month program to change the fare algorithm to offer lower fares, and, and increasing advertising; in rural and suburban cities may boost ridership and enable local populations to recoginze the ridesharing company brand as a positive influence to the city's economy.
